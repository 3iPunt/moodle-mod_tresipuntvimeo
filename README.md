# Tresipunt Vimeo #

This module allows users to upload a video as a resource, which is then automatically uploaded to their Vimeo account through a scheduled task. 

If you already know the video ID, you can enter it directly. When rendering the video, if the upload process is still ongoing, Vimeo displays a message indicating that the video is being uploaded.
